INTRODUCTION

This report reflects on the implementation of the Healthcare Management System,
demonstrating how the designs from Part 1 (use case diagram, class diagram, and
three-tier architecture) have been realized in a working Java application using
the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

REALIZATION OF PART 1 DESIGNS IN IMPLEMENTATION

The class diagram from Part 1 provided the blueprint for all model classes. The
abstract User class serves as the parent for Patient, with concrete clinician
types (GP, Specialist, Nurse) extending the abstract Clinician class, exactly
as designed. The inheritance hierarchy has been preserved, with appropriate
method implementations in each subclass. For instance, the createRecord()
abstract method in Clinician is implemented differently in GP, Specialist, and
Nurse classes, reflecting their distinct roles in clinical documentation.

The aggregation relationships identified in Part 1, particularly between Patient
and Appointment, and Patient and ClinicalRecord, have been implemented using
ArrayList collections. This allows patients to maintain their own lists of
appointments and clinical records, enabling efficient data management. The
Prescription and Referral classes include all attributes specified in the class
diagram, with appropriate getter/setter methods and business logic methods such
as validate() for Prescription and sendReferral() for Referral.

The use case diagram influenced the implementation of user interactions. Each
use case (book appointment, create prescription, generate referral) maps to
specific methods in the model classes and controller operations. The "include"
relationships for authentication and the "extend" relationships for specialized
workflows guided the separation of concerns in the implementation.

APPLICATION OF MVC PATTERN

The MVC pattern has been rigorously applied to structure the codebase, ensuring
clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

The MODEL layer comprises all classes in the model package (User, Patient,
Clinician, GP, Specialist, Nurse, Appointment, Prescription, Referral,
ClinicalRecord). These classes encapsulate data and business logic independent
of presentation concerns. The ReferralManager singleton, implemented in the
controller package, manages referral-specific operations while maintaining a
single instance throughout the application lifecycle.

The VIEW layer includes all GUI components in the view package. The MainFrame
class provides the primary user interface with tabbed panels for different data
types. Dialog classes (PatientDialog, AppointmentDialog, PrescriptionDialog,
ReferralDialog) handle create/edit operations. The view layer contains no
business logic - it purely focuses on presentation and user interaction,
delegating all data operations to the controller.

The CONTROLLER layer is represented by DataManager and ReferralManager. The
DataManager acts as the central coordinator, managing all data collections and
providing CRUD operations. It uses the CSVHandler utility to persist data,
demonstrating the controller's role in mediating between model and view. When
the MainFrame needs to display patients, it requests data from DataManager
rather than accessing CSV files directly. Similarly, when adding a new
prescription through PrescriptionDialog, the request flows through DataManager,
which handles both data persistence and output file generation.

DESIGN PATTERNS AND ARCHITECTURE

The Singleton pattern implementation for ReferralManager ensures centralized
control over all referral operations, preventing duplicate instances and
maintaining data consistency. This was crucial given the requirement for audit
trails and email simulations. The eager initialization approach (creating the
instance at class loading) guarantees thread safety in this application context.

The three-tier architecture from Part 1 is reflected in the package structure:
the presentation tier (view package), business logic tier (controller and model
packages), and data tier (CSV files with CSVHandler utility). This separation
allows independent modification of each tier.

CONCLUSION

The implementation successfully translates Part 1 designs into a functional
system. The MVC pattern provides clear code organization, while the Singleton
pattern ensures robust referral management. The iterative development process,
evidenced by git commits, demonstrates progressive feature implementation from
basic models to complete GUI functionality.
